The portfolio:

The website i did convey my protfolio and the final assignment in the responsive webdesign 2 course.

Description:
I started with the navigation of the website at the top of each page and the footer with some information about me in each page.
Home page:I started with the home page as i put my profile photo with my career. Then when the page is going down some of my latest works are shown. All photos and work are taken by me.
About page: in this page there is information about me  and the image i played around with the css to make it as a frame hanging on a wall. and this photo is me and taken by me with some frame works before adding it.
Portfolio page: is the page that represents my all skills and some examples of my work.All the photos are taken and done by me. Only two photos in the more skills section in the web development and quickbook are taken from unsplash website.
Contact page:  the last page represents a form and button to send me an email. The image is taken from unsplash website.

The barriers i faced:
Trying to use java script and some plug ins for more animation but faced some difficulties in applying it to be pushed in github so i had to remove them and use only what i have learned in this semester. In addition, even though its easy using css with the bootstrap but still not many options can be added especially that i used the bootstrap as the basic to give the responsive and well-organized website.But i played with some css animations and the colors to give me better satisfying results.
